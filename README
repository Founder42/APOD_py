apod.py

This is a wee little python script to pull down the APOD and, in OS X,
possibly set the desktop background. It does handle exceptions, writing
useful (usually) error messages to stderr. The default behaviour of the
script is to:
    1. load the APOD page and determine what the APOD is.
    2. grab the APOD url.
    3. open a temporary file and save the image there.
    4. determine the filename to save the image as the base name from the 
       APOD (i.e. images/1011/APOD_cool_pic.jpg -> APOD_cool_pic.jpg) and 
       append the date the image was grabbed, i.e. APOD_cool_pic_20101110.
    5. check to see if a file with that name exists in the given path.
    6. if not, save the file. if the file already exists, exit the script.
    7. if the file was saved and the --set flag was passed, check to see
       what OS the host is running. currently only supports setting the
       wallpaper in OS X. 
    8. fin.

The default directory to save images in is ${HOME}/Pictures/apod/
I have no idea if ${HOME} is set in windows. Please note that since I do
not have any win32 systems, I haven't tested this script under windows.
Caveat emptor.

usage: apod.py [-h] [-s] [-p PATH]

APOD script arguments

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --set             flag to cause the script to set the desktop 
                        background to the downloaded image.
  -p PATH, --path PATH  path to store downloaded images in

WHY DESKTOP BACKGROUND CHANGING IS ONLY SUPPORTED IN OS X:
    win32:      I have no win32 systems, therefore I both don't really care
                all that much and can't really test it. Feel free to do it.
    linux2:     Way too many desktop systems and no reliable way to tell
                what desktop environment or window manager the user is 
                using or how to set the desktop background for that user.
    ???         I probably don't have ???. Maybe one day Haiku will be 
                supported.
